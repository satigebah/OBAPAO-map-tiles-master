# BIOPAMA-map-tiles
The map interaction tiles are generated from these geojson files
# Tippecanoe
The BIOPAMA RIS uses vector tiles to render the data quickly. The tiles need to be vector to allow FAST restyling of the data using the mapbox API. We use the vector layers for both site browsing and data interaction.
To make everything work as quickly as possible we serve the vector tiles from a disk cache using tippecanoe.
## Customising the tiles
### Installing tippecanoe
Install tippecanoe following the instructions in the repo:
https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe
### Geojson
Create a geojson of the spatial data that will be used.
There's samples of geojson data found in the sub-directories.

### Creating a tile cache
We need 2 tile caches:
1. Polygons - for all the countries and protected areas
1. Points - for all the labels, and any protected areas that are points


Here's a sample for the commands to create a tile cache:  

 - ````cd WestAfrica````

 - ````tippecanoe -e BIOPAMA_poly -z12 --coalesce-densest-as-needed --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping --force WDPA2019MayPoly_West_Africa.geojson ACP_GAUL_West_Africa.geojson ACP_EEZ_West_Africa.geojson ACP_Countries_West_Africa.geojson ACP_SubGroups_West_Africa.geojson````

 - ````tippecanoe -e BIOPAMA_point -z12 -r1 --force ACP_Countries_Points_West_Africa.geojson ACP_SubGroups_points_West_Africa.geojson WDPA2019MayPoints_West_Africa.geojson WDPA2019MayPolyPoints_West_Africa.geojson````


#### breaking down what the command does:
-  -e BIOPAMA_poly //the name of the generated tile cache
- -z12 //to force generating tiles to zoom12
- --coalesce-densest-as-needed //simplifies the tile output if it gets too dense.
- --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping //adds aditional zoom level if any nodes were dropped at the previous zoom level
- -r1 //to force including all points (important for point layers)
- --force //allows rewriting layers without giving an error message
- the list of geojson files //all the files that will be combined in the tile cache

# Updating the RIS
Once the map tile cache has been generated using tippecanoe you can update the BIOPAMA RIS site to use the new layers.
## JS
There is only 1 javascript file that must be updated. It's in the "BIOPAMA_configs" folder of the root web directory for the RIS. The folder contains all of the local site settings unique to the region. So far this is just the map.
- \BIOPAMA_configs\map_settings.js

### Tippecanoe Map Layer Names 
You will find a list of the layer names that were used in generating the tippecanoe cache. You can update the layers to match the names used from YOUR geojson files. **if you are not sure. The exact names you need are output by tippecanoe after generating the tile cache**

### Map Tile Host URL
The tile cache source. You can search for 'map.addSource("BIOPAMA_Poly", {' to update the server path to where your tile cache is located. **it needs to be done for both polygons and points**

### Map Center on Homepage
The center and zoom options will change where the map is pointing when it first loads.
